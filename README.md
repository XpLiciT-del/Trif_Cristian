# Auto Repair Workshop Management – SQL Project

This project simulates the management of an auto repair workshop and was developed as part of the Software Testing course.

It demonstrates the use of a relational database to store and manage information about:
- clients and their personal data,
- vehicles owned by clients,
- repairs associated with each vehicle,
- spare parts used in each repair,
- mechanics assigned to repairs,
- driving licenses (permits) associated with mechanics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
