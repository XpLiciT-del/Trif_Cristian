# Database Project for "Auto Repair Workshop Management"

The scope of this project is to use all the SQL knowledge gained throughout the Software Testing course and apply it in practice.

## Application under test:
Auto Repair Workshop Management

## Tools used:
MySQL Workbench

## Database description:

This database simulates the management of an auto repair workshop. It stores information about clients, their vehicles, the repairs performed, parts used in those repairs, and the mechanics involved. It also tracks the permits of the mechanics.

## Database Schema:

You can find below the database schema that was generated through Reverse Engineer and which contains all the tables and the relationships between them.

The tables are connected in the following way:
- **Clienti** is connected with **Masini** through a one-to-many relationship.
- **Masini** is connected with **Reparatii** through a one-to-many relationship.
- **Reparatii** is connected with **Piese** through a many-to-many relationship via the **Reparatii_Piese** table.
- **Reparatii** is connected with **Mecanici** through a many-to-many relationship via the **Mecanici_Reparatii** table.
- **Mecanici** is connected with **Permise** through a one-to-one relationship.

These relationships were implemented using the following primary and foreign keys:
- **Clienti.id_client** as a primary key and **Masini.id_client** as a foreign key.
- **Masini.id_masina** as a primary key and **Reparatii.id_masina** as a foreign key.
- **Reparatii.id_reparatie** as a primary key and **Reparatii_Piese.id_reparatie** as a foreign key.
- **Piese.id_piesa** as a primary key and **Reparatii_Piese.id_piesa** as a foreign key.
- **Reparatii.id_reparatie** as a primary key and **Mecanici_Reparatii.id_reparatie** as a foreign key.
- **Mecanici.id_mecanic** as a primary key and **Mecanici_Reparatii.id_mecanic** as a foreign key.
- **Mecanici.id_mecanic** as a primary key and **Permise.id_mecanic** as a foreign key.

## SQL Commands

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

--The following instructions were written in the scope of CREATING the structure of the database (CREATE INSTRUCTIONS):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE  atelierauto;
    USE atelierauto;

CREATE TABLE Clienti (
    id_client INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    nume VARCHAR(100),
    telefon VARCHAR(15),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    cnp CHAR(13)
);

CREATE TABLE Masini (
    id_masina INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    id_client INT,
    marca VARCHAR(50),
    model VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (id_client) REFERENCES Clienti(id_client)
);

CREATE TABLE Reparatii (
    id_reparatie INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    id_masina INT,
    descriere VARCHAR(255),
    cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (id_masina) REFERENCES Masini(id_masina)
);

CREATE TABLE Piese (
    id_piesa INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    nume_piesa VARCHAR(100),
    stoc INT
);

CREATE TABLE Reparatii_Piese (
    id_reparatie INT,
    id_piesa INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id_reparatie, id_piesa),
    FOREIGN KEY (id_reparatie) REFERENCES Reparatii(id_reparatie),
    FOREIGN KEY (id_piesa) REFERENCES Piese(id_piesa)
);

CREATE TABLE Mecanici (
    id_mecanic INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    nume VARCHAR(100),
    specializare VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Mecanici_Reparatii (
    id_mecanic INT,
    id_reparatie INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id_mecanic, id_reparatie),
    FOREIGN KEY (id_mecanic) REFERENCES Mecanici(id_mecanic),
    FOREIGN KEY (id_reparatie) REFERENCES Reparatii(id_reparatie)
);

CREATE TABLE Permise (
    id_permis INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    id_mecanic INT UNIQUE,
    tip_permis VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (id_mecanic) REFERENCES Mecanici(id_mecanic)
);

CREATE TABLE Feedback (
    id_feedback INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    id_client INT,
    comentariu TEXT,
    data_feedback DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (id_client) REFERENCES Clienti(id_client)
);


```

After the database and the tables were created, I used a few additional DDL commands to manage and clean specific tables.  
These included `DROP COLUMN` to remove unnecessary fields and `TRUNCATE` to quickly delete all data from a table while keeping its structure intact, as described below:

```sql

TRUNCATE TABLE Mecanici;
DROP TABLE Feedback;


```

After the database and the tables have been created, a few ALTER instructions were written in order to update the structure of the database, as described below:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Clienti ADD cnp CHAR(13);
ALTER TABLE Permise RENAME TO Permise_Mecanici;
ALTER TABLE Clienti ADD COLUMN data_inregistrare DATE;
ALTER TABLE Clienti DROP COLUMN data_inregistrare;
ALTER TABLE Masini ADD COLUMN culoare_masinii VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE Masini CHANGE culoare_masinii culoare VARCHAR(30);
ALTER TABLE Piese MODIFY COLUMN id_piesa INT AUTO_INCREMENT;
ALTER TABLE Reparatii ADD COLUMN descriere_reparatii VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE Reparatii MODIFY COLUMN descriere_reparatii VARCHAR(20) AFTER id_masina;
ALTER TABLE Piese ADD COLUMN stoc INT;

```

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

  In order to be able to use the database I populated the tables with various data necessary in order to perform queries and manipulate the data. 
  In the testing process, this necessary data is identified in the Test Design phase and created in the Test Implementation phase.

```sql
INSERT INTO Clienti (nume, telefon, email, cnp) VALUES ('Marcel Popescu', '0722000000', 'marcel@email.com', '1980101223344');

INSERT INTO Masini (id_client, marca, model) VALUES (1, 'Dacia', 'Logan');

INSERT INTO Reparatii (id_masina, descriere, cost) VALUES (1, 'Schimb ulei', 200.00);

INSERT INTO Piese (nume_piesa, stoc) VALUES ('Filtru ulei', 10);

INSERT INTO Reparatii_Piese (id_reparatie, id_piesa) VALUES (1, 1);

INSERT INTO Mecanici (nume, specializare) VALUES ('Ion Ionescu', 'Electrician');

INSERT INTO Mecanici_Reparatii (id_mecanic, id_reparatie) VALUES (1, 1);

INSERT INTO Permise (id_mecanic, tip_permis) VALUES (1, 'B');

INSERT INTO Clienti VALUES (5, 'Ana Radu', 'ana@email.com', '0733111222', '2871010112233');

INSERT INTO Piese (nume_piesa, stoc)
VALUES 
  ('Ulei motor', 15),
  ('Bec far', 30),
  ('Plăcuțe frână', 20);

```

After the insert, in order to prepare the data to be better suited for the testing process, I updated some data in the following way:

```sql

UPDATE Clienti
SET telefon = '0744000111'
WHERE id_client = 1;

UPDATE Reparatii
SET descriere = 'Schimb ulei + filtru'
WHERE descriere = 'Schimb ulei';

UPDATE Mecanici
SET specializare = 'Diagnoză electrică'
WHERE nume = 'Ion Ionescu';

UPDATE Piese SET stoc = 9 WHERE id_piesa = 1;

```

After the testing process, I deleted the data that was no longer relevant in order to preserve the database clean: 

```sql

DELETE FROM Clienti
WHERE nume = 'Denisa';

DELETE FROM Piese
WHERE nume_piesa = 'Plăcuțe frână';


```

### DQL (Data Query Language)

In order to simulate various scenarios that might happen in real life I created the following queries that would cover multiple potential real-life situations:

```sql
-- WHERE
SELECT * FROM Clienti
WHERE nume = 'Gina';

-- AND
SELECT * FROM Clienti
WHERE email LIKE '%gmail.com' AND telefon LIKE '07%';

-- OR
SELECT * FROM Clienti
WHERE email LIKE '%yahoo.com' OR telefon LIKE '07%';

-- LIKE
SELECT * FROM Clienti
WHERE email LIKE '%gmail.com';

SELECT * FROM Clienti
WHERE email LIKE '%yahoo.com' OR telefon LIKE '07%';

-- NOT (completare recomandată)
SELECT * FROM Clienti
WHERE NOT email LIKE '%icloud.com';

-- INNER JOIN
SELECT c.nume, m.marca, m.model, r.descriere, r.cost
FROM Clienti c
INNER JOIN Masini m ON c.id_client = m.id_client
INNER JOIN Reparatii r ON m.id_masina = r.id_masina;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT c.nume, m.marca
FROM Clienti c
LEFT JOIN Masini m ON c.id_client = m.id_client;

-- RIGHT JOIN
SELECT c.nume, m.marca
FROM Clienti c
RIGHT JOIN Masini m ON c.id_client = m.id_client;

-- CROSS JOIN 
SELECT c.nume, p.nume_piesa
FROM Clienti c
CROSS JOIN Piese p;

-- COUNT + GROUP BY
SELECT id_masina, COUNT(*) AS nr_reparatii
FROM Reparatii
GROUP BY id_masina;

-- HAVING
SELECT id_masina, COUNT(*) AS nr_reparatii
FROM Reparatii
GROUP BY id_masina
HAVING nr_reparatii > 1;

-- SUBQUERY
SELECT * FROM Clienti
WHERE id_client IN (
  SELECT id_client FROM Masini WHERE marca = 'Dacia'
);

```


## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the creation and management of a structured relational database for a real-world scenario — an auto repair workshop. It involved designing normalized tables, enforcing referential integrity through primary and foreign keys, and performing CRUD operations. Through DDL, DML, and DQL commands, we validated the schema design, tested constraints, and simulated meaningful business operations. Additionally, JOINs and subqueries were used to retrieve relevant data.
